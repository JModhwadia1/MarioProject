# MarioProject
This is a Mario Project which was done for semester 2 for Games Engine Creation. I created this project as it was a assignment 
this mudule. I have used the SDL Framework which was given to us and C++ to program the classic arcade style game. You can use 
Arrow Keys to move Luigi and WASD for mario.
